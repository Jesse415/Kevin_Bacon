The object of the Kevin Bacon Game is to link a movie actor to Kevin Bacon via shared movie roles.

## Objective
The object of the Kevin Bacon Game is to link a movie actor to Kevin Bacon
via shared movie roles. The minimum number of links is an actor’s Bacon
number.  For instance, Tom Hanks has a Bacon number of 1; he was in Apollo
13 with Kevin Bacon. Sally Fields has a Bacon number of 2, because she was
in Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks, who was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon.
Almost all well-known actors have a Bacon number of 1 or 2. Given a list of
actors, with roles, write a C++ program that does the following:

(a) Finds an actor’s Bacon number.

(b) Finds the actor with the highest Bacon number.

(c) Finds the minimum number of links between two arbitrary actors.
